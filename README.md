## üìä Database Schema

The system uses a relational database with the following core entities:

- **Users** - Base user accounts (doctors, patients, pharmacists, admins)
- **Patients** - Patient-specific information and medical history
- **Doctors** - Doctor credentials and hospital affiliations
- **Medical Visits** - Individual consultation records
- **Prescriptions** - Digital prescriptions linked to visits
- **Prescription Items** - Individual medications within prescriptions
- **QR Codes** - Secure QR codes for prescription verification
- **Pharmacy Logs** - Audit trail of pharmacy interactions

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

The system implements role-based access control with four user types:

- **Admin**: Full system access and user management
- **Doctor**: Create prescriptions, view patient records, manage visits
- **Pharmacist**: Scan and fulfill prescriptions, view pharmacy logs
- **Patient**: View own medical history and prescriptions

## üì± API Endpoints
